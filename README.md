# Messenger

The functionality of this application is similar to the most popular app on the Internet called Messenger designed by Facebook Inc. Graphic design is invented by me and is prepared to work on every iPhone's. The app provides secure connection to the Firebase server that enables users successful registration. After correct registration users could login to their accounts using an email addresses. Every sent messages are stored on the server and nobody from outside has access to them. There are implemented methods to protect against getting messages that were not addressed to us.
